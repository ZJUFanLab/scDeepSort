Installation Guide
==================

Stable Version
--------------

The stable version is compressed into a single file. Please download `the tar file<https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort/releases>` from the GitHub release page.

The package is then available using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xxx.tar.gz

The package is used a few package dependencies which will be handled automatically. It is recommended to use the package environment from `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__ since it already installs all required packages.

Notice that only the 64-bit Linux are officially supported.
